      To be, or not to be, that is the question:
      <br>
      Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
      <br>
      The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
      <br>
      Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
      <br>
      And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
      <br>
      No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
      <br>
      The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks
      <br>
      That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
      <br>
      Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
      <br>
      To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
      <br>
      For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
      <br>
      When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
      <br>
      Must give us pause. There's the respect
      <br>
      That makes Calamity of so long life:
      <br>
      For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
      <br>
      The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely, [F: poor]
      <br>
      The pangs of despised Love, the Lawâ€™s delay, [F: disprized]
      <br>
      The insolence of Office, and the Spurns
      <br>
      That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
      <br>
      When he himself might his Quietus make
      <br>
      With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear, [F: these Fardels]
      <br>
      To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
      <br>
      But that the dread of something after death,
      <br>
      The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn
      <br>
      No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,
      <br>
      And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
      <br>
      Than fly to others that we know not of.
      <br>
      Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,
      <br>
      And thus the Native hue of Resolution
      <br>
      Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,
      <br>
      And enterprises of great pitch and moment, [F: pith]
      <br>
      With this regard their Currents turn awry, [F: away]
      <br>
      And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
      <br>
      The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
      <br>
      Be all my sins remembered.
